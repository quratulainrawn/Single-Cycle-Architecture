# Single-Cycle-Architecture
Lab Description: Single Cycle Processor Architecture
Objective:
To design, implement, and analyze a single-cycle processor architecture for executing basic instructions. The lab focuses on understanding the operation of a processor where each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle.

Key Concepts Covered:

Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):
Introduction to a simplified instruction set, including arithmetic, logical, memory access, and control instructions.

Datapath Design:

Components: Understanding the role of the ALU, registers, memory, multiplexers, and control signals.
Connections: How components are connected to form the datapath.
Instruction Flow: How instructions flow through the datapath for execution.
Control Unit Design:

Generating control signals to direct data flow and operations in the datapath.
Designing control logic using truth tables and Boolean equations.
Clock Cycle:
Overview of how a single instruction completes execution within one clock cycle.

Lab Activities:

Analyzing the ISA:
Identify the supported instructions and their formats (e.g., R-type, I-type).

Designing the Datapath:

Build the datapath for the processor, including all required components.
Label each connection and understand the flow of data.
Implementing the Control Unit:

Derive control signals for each instruction.
Use combinational logic to implement the control unit.
Simulating the Architecture:

Use tools like Logisim, Verilog, or ModelSim to simulate the processor.
Test execution of instructions such as addition, subtraction, memory read/write, and branching.
Testing and Debugging:

Test the processor with a predefined set of instructions.
Debug any errors in datapath or control signal generation.
Deliverables:

Design Documentation:

Block diagrams of the datapath and control unit.
Truth tables and equations for control signals.
Simulation Results:

Screenshots or logs demonstrating successful instruction execution.
Timing diagrams showing signal transitions for a sample instruction.
Discussion and Analysis:

Evaluate the advantages and limitations of a single-cycle processor.
Discuss how cycle time affects performance and compare it with multi-cycle processors.
Expected Outcomes:

A functional single-cycle processor capable of executing basic instructions.
A solid understanding of datapath and control unit integration.
Insights into processor performance and design trade-offs.
Prerequisites:

Basics of digital logic design.
Familiarity with instruction formats and assembly language.
Understanding of clock cycles and combinational/sequential circuits.
This lab provides a foundational understanding of processor architecture, paving the way for studying advanced designs like pipelined and multi-cycle processors.
